Thanks for contributing.

## Development Setup

1. Install Hammerspoon.
2. Clone this repo.
3. Run `./install.sh` to link it into `~/.hammerspoon/`.
4. Reload Hammerspoon: `open -g "hammerspoon://reload"`.

## Making Changes

- Keep changes focused and easy to review.
- Prefer macOS-friendly behavior and defensive coding (Hammerspoon can be missing APIs depending on version).
- Update `README.md` if you change install/config behavior.

## Pull Requests

- Describe what changed and why.
- Include screenshots or a short recording if the behavior is visual.
